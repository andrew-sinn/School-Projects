READ_ME - Python Projects (run in Python 3.2.2)

Hello world program - HelloWorld.py
Matrix transpose (Project 3 Problem 3) - Transpose.py

Run both programs at the command line.
The transpose program implemented here is the same as the one found in Project 3.
It expects clean input from the start (no dirty input).
