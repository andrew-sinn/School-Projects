**********************GENERAL INFORMATION*************************
****************PLEASE READ BEFORE STARTING PROGRAM***************
==================================================================

	Here are a couple good things to know before starting the 
program. First of all the default User ID and password for the 
system is the following.

	USERID: Admin
	PASSWORD: Password	

	After entering your password for the first time you will 
be prompted to change your password. This is true for any 
employee logging in for the first time. Secondly when first using
the system there are no preloaded menu items, employees, toppings,
or locations so you must set all of these beforehand. This is 
further explained later. Follow the next steps to get your 
program started.
